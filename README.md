# Leveler
Require Pillow (`pip3 install Pillow`)

Modifyed/Updated Leverler cog from Malarne / discord_cogs.
Replaced deprecated code and customized for The DAB Server.

NOTE!
This was updated for use on my personal discord. 
The changes I made were through trial and error.
If you have any issues trying to use this on your own server, good fucking luck bro.
I don't really know shit about python.
